# TTN references

In this folder some of the works we used to study the correct way to implement a TTN classifier are presented:

- **`1605.05775.pdf`** discuss how a tensor networks can be used for a supervised learning task;
- **`2004.13747.pdf`** presents the results of the implementation of a Tree Tensor Networks for the binary classification task on LHCb open data;
- **`1402.4735.pdf`** is the original paper from the Baldi group where the binary classification task over the dataset we used is discussed using Deep Neural Networks.
